# random-string-generator web application markdown file.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was my fascination with generating random strings. Additionally,
generating long random passwords is becoming essential to protect your information online.

## Program Objective 
Generate four different types of random strings based on desired length, put them into a database, and give
the user the ability to download as a text file if they wish. 

## How to compile and run the program
While in the RandomStringDirectory, run 'node server.js', then go to the url specified.
After reaching the web application, select one of the four tabs and enter a desired length.
